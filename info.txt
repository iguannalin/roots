一 thousands of years ago, ancestors looked at the natural world around them, and replicated its likeness permanently--possibly carving them in bones. these pictographs have persisted through time, evolving into essential components (radicals) that make up chinese characters.

二 when i look at these radicals, i am reminded of the history, and the culture these radicals have preserved, and continue to radicalize; for me, it characterizes a primal human desire to grow with each other, to empathize, and to share a common ground so as to relate to each other better.

三 we have existed alongside nature for millennia, sometimes we admire its awe, and sometimes we destroy it. in the words of my friend jo[link], this piece evokes the sense of human presence in nature but in negation.

you are welcome to grow some grass; over time, the grass radicals will regenerate as tree radicals.
