# roots

how it works:
- touching the screen will grow a patch of grass around that touch point
- there is a max on how much grass in the whole space and how much tree you can grow in one area
- the max changes depending on whether you are on the mobile or desktop version
- if the grass max is met, then older grass will die off, eventually leaving behind the initial touch point grass
- trees will start growing an ample amount of grass is grown; trees grow at their own pace, much slower than that of grass
